# TODO

- complete test coverage
- refactor so all BS4 stuff takes place in parser class(es)
- make changes to GUI (see `gui.py`)
- use pathlib instea of os module

- Travis CI
- setup tools sorted so a proper installation process can work
- upload to pypi

- Docker? Not sure if pointless as it is not a web app.
