# TODO

- Use config file to determine where to download mangas to (package default config file too)
- delete jpgs after converting to pdf/cbz

- complete test coverage
- refactor so all BS4 stuff takes place in parser class(es)
- make changes to GUI (see `gui.py`)
- use pathlib instea of os module
- mypy for type checking

- Travis CI
