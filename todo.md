# TODO

- allow `--source all` to search all sources
- parser `multi` for multiple parser

## Soon

- remove module wide vars like `MANGA_DIR`
- change the dir to save mangas to in uploader (perhaps by adding something to config)

- support Windows (will need to fix windows boot partition first)

- rent space on digital ocean to run this and upload to dropbox

- complete test coverage

## Features

- colour the cli?
