# TODO

Tests

- refactor tests a little

## Future

- use pathlib instead of os module
- profiling
- Fuzzy search --manga arg if an exact match is not found & bring up suggestions in a table to select like in --search
- mypy for type checking
- make changes to GUI (see `gui.py`)
- complete test coverage

## Nice to Haves

- Travis CI
- Docker? Not sure if pointless as it is not a web app.
