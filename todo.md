# TODO

Tests

## Future

- Fuzzy search --manga arg if an exact match is not found & bring up suggestions in a table to select like in --search
- remove `config.py` and use a settings config file instead
- complete test coverage
- make changes to GUI (see `gui.py`)
- use pathlib instea of os module
- profiling
- mypy for type checking

## Nice to Haves

- Travis CI
- Docker? Not sure if pointless as it is not a web app.
