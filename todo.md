# TODO

- TEST override manga name

- allow `--source all` to search all sources
- parser `multi` for multiple parser

- new config options that override default options:
  - `type` for --filetype
  - `source` for --source

## Soon

- remove module wide vars like `MANGA_DIR`
- change the dir to save mangas to in uploader (perhaps by adding something to config)

- support Windows (will need to fix windows boot partition first)

- rent space on digital ocean to run this and upload to dropbox

- complete test coverage

## Features

- allow to search for genres & type?
- colour the cli?
